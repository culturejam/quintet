Quintet
========

This is a fork of jquery-form-builder-plugin
The intent is to use
 1. jQuery 
 2. jQuery UI 
 3. Bootstrap 
    to produce 
 4. Forms 
 5. Views
    hence 'Quintet'.

Furthermore, this code should stand on it's own, when detecting the protocol 'file://' it should use localData as a database.
One should be able to take this code and start connecting to any backend.

Status
=======

That early stadium where everything is still described as 'should'
