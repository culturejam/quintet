<h3>Quintet</h3>

<u>What is it ?</u>

This is a fork of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin/'>jquery-form-builder-plugin</a> by <a href='https://github.com/limcheekin'>limcheekin</a>, the intent is to use

1) jQuery
2) jQuery UI
3) Bootstrap

to produce

4) Forms
5) Views

hence 'Quintet'.

Furthermore, this code should stand on it's own, when detecting the protocol 'file://' it should use localData as a database.
One should be able to take this code and start connecting to any backend.

<u>Status</u>

That early stadium where everything is still described as 'should'.
Also, after introducing the bootstrap css file it looks uglier, not for the faint of heart until some more work is done.

<u>Todo</u>

The todo can be found in the root ( TODO.txt )

<u>Philosophy</u>

The same set of javascript files should be used for form building, view building and actually serving the forms and views.
Adding new widgets should be accomplished by adding new quintet.<widget>.js files, preferably starting from cloning quintet.singlefieldtext.js
Every widget javascript registers itself, so there is no need to make any changes in quintet.js
For now, a button needs to be added to quintet.html, but the list of buttons should become generated at some point.

There is a departure from the original in that some features have been left out as 'gold plating'.

Also the coding style is different, there is much more whitespace, comments and string manipulation ( vs. DOM manipulation ).
Tabbing should be done with tabs, tabs were meant to take 2 spaces. You will notice that my editors do not always agree with me.

This makes the code much more approachable IMHO, we will see how that works out.

Finally, Quintet is supposed to be work in tandem with a backend, this is not in scope for this project.
All communication with that backend should be done with the JSON format because it is awesome and the future.
