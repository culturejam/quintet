<h3>Quintet</h3>

<u>What is it ?</u>

This is a fork of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin/'>jquery-form-builder-plugin</a> by <a href='https://github.com/limcheekin'>limcheekin</a>, the intent is to use

1) jQuery
2) jQuery UI
3) Bootstrap

to produce

4) Forms
5) Views

hence 'Quintet'.

Furthermore, this code should stand on it's own, when Quintet detects that it is
host from 'file://' it should use localData as a database. One should be able to
take this code and start connecting to any backend.

<u>Status</u>

That early stadium where everything is still described as 'should'.

<u>Todo</u>

The todo can be found in the root ( TODO.txt )

<u>Philosophy</u>

The same set of javascript files should be used for form building, view building
and actually serving the forms and views. Adding new widgets is done through new
quintet.<widget>.js files, preferably starting from cloning quintet.singlefieldtext.js

Every widget registers itself, so there should be no need to make any changes in
quintet.js. For now, a button needs to be added to quintet.html, the list of the
buttons should become generated at some point.

There is a departure from the original in that some features have been left out 
as 'gold plating'. ( Font color .. )

Also the coding style is different; more white space, comments and sprintf magic
with innerHTML instead of using DOM manipulation. Indented with two spaces, you
will notice from the commits that I violate this rule quite frequently. I blame 
my text editors..

This makes the code much more approachable IMHO, we will see how that works out.

Finally, Quintet is supposed to be work in tandem with a backend, this is not in
scope for this project. All communication with that backend should be done using
the JSON format because it is awesome and the future.

<u>Required functions and properties for a widget</u>

* createOptions()
* createOptionsUI()
* create()
* update() &lt;- TODO
* id

<u>Thoughts on DRY</u>

This code violates DRY in several places, this is done to force compartmentalized 
widget code. Feel free to create issues on github if you see DRY violations outside 
of quintet.&lt;widget&gt;.js
